## About Me

I'm a software engineer and tech lead who loves building scalable systems and solving complex problems. My journey has taken me from developing backend services to leading engineering teams and architecting enterprise solutions.

What drives me is creating software that makes a real difference‚Äîwhether that's cutting deployment time, optimizing performance, or making systems more resilient. I enjoy mentoring other developers and believe in writing clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me sharing knowledge with the community and continuously exploring new technologies.
